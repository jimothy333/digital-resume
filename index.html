        I learned skills in programs such as 2D AutoCAD, Microsoft Excel, and Autodesk Inventor as well as the application of them in the making of bus.
        I also Wired and tested control panels that were used for measuring and maintaining air pressure in the bus as well as a temperature control panel
        for the heaters to turn on and off automatically when temperature reached a certain point for the customer. This experience also helped me improve
